# fairmofsyncondition is a machine learning package for predicting the        #
# synthesis condition of the crystal structures of MOFs. It is also intended  #
# for predicting all MOFs the can be generated from a given set of conditions #
# In addition the package also predicts the stability of MOFs, compute their  #
# their PXRD and crystallite sizes. This package is part of our effort to     #
# to accelerate the discovery and optimization of the synthesises of novel    #
# high performing MOFs. This package is being developed by Dr Dinga Wonanke   #
# as part of hos MSCA post doctoral fellowship at TU Dresden.                 #
#                                                                             #
